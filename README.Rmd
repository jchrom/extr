API client for Trello
---------------------

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jchrom/trelloR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jchrom/trelloR)
[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/trelloR)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=trelloR)
[![Rdoc](http://www.rdocumentation.org/badges/version/trelloR)](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/trelloR)

The purpose of `trelloR` is to help you interact with the [Trello API](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/rest) from R.

### Example

Request cards and return a data frame:

```r
library(trelloR)
board = "https://trello.com/b/wVWPK9I4/r-client-for-the-trello-api"
cards = get_board_cards(board)
```

### Get it from GitHub

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jchrom/trelloR")
```

__CRAN (version 0.1)__

The CRAN version is in dire need of an update, which will happen when 0.7 is
released (hopefully very soon). In the meantime, please use the development
version above.

### Imports

trelloR is built using [httr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=httr) and [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/package=jsonlite).
